### The HiLo👋 Colormap!

Introducing the HiLo colormap to napari! 🎨
This much-loved colormap (LUT) visualizes the maximum contrast limit as red 🔴 and the minimum contrast limit as blue 🔵.
In the scientific imaging world, the HiLo colormap is often used to assess overexposed (saturated) ☀️ and underexposed (dark) 🌑 regions in images.

The HiLo colormap is now available as a result of the dependency bump to VisPy 0.15.0 [#7846](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7846), and will soon unlock some great new features in the coming napari releases.
