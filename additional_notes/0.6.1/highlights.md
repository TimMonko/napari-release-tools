### The HiLo👋 Colormap!

Introducing the HiLo colormap to napari! 🎨 This much-loved colormap (LUT) is like grayscale, except it displays values at or above the maximum contrast limit as red 🔴 and values at or below the minimum contrast limit as blue 🔵. In the scientific imaging world, the HiLo colormap is often used to assess overexposed (saturated) ☀️ and underexposed (dark) 🌑 regions in images.

The HiLo colormap is now available as a result of the dependency bump to VisPy 0.15.0 [(#7846)](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7846), which will soon unlock even more great new features in the coming napari releases.
