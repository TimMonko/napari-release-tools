### A Zoom with a View üîç

Pardon the play on words, but you can now zoom directly to a region of interest in the viewer by holding `Alt` and dragging with the mouse [(#8004)](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8004). The camera will pan and zoom to fit the selected region, making it much easier to focus on specific areas of your data. This feature works in both 2D and 3D views.

### Fine Tuning Thick Slicing from the GUI üìè

Thick slicing controls are now available in the GUI [(#6146)](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6146)! This allows you to project multiple slices together using different modes (sum, mean, max, and min) for better visualization of your multidimensional data. You can access the thickness controls by right-clicking on the dimension sliders to open a popup to change the margins either symmetrically or asymmetrical and projection mode settings are now available per layer in the layer controls widget.

### Windows: Access ~~Denied~~ Fixed ü™ü

A critical Windows-specific bug that caused Access Violation errors has been resolved [(#8122)](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/8122)! This longstanding issue would cause napari to stop displaying layers due to various events and often occurred at seemingly non-reproducible times, and required a full restart of napari. The fix ensures proper cleanup and syncing of GPU resources, also reducing memory usage on all platforms. If you were an effected user, you may recall it as `Access Violation`, `0x000000000000001C` if triggered without a plugin, or `0x000000000000034C` if triggered with a plugin.

### Improved PySide6 Support üõ†Ô∏è

Napari now has improved support for PySide6 [(#7887)](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7887), resolving various compatibility issues and segfaults. This update enhances stability across platforms and prepares napari for the future as Qt5 approaches end-of-life.
